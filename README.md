### Reflection  
In the career counseling session, I was tasked with identifying the specific skills, knowledge, and experiences necessary for advancing in my career path. This process started with a self-evaluation, during which I compiled a comprehensive list of criteria matching the role and career I aim to achieve. By comparing these requirements with my existing skills, I discovered a significant gap especially in fields such as advanced technical certifications, experience in project leadership, and involvement with cross-functional teams. This understanding made me recognize that although I have a strong foundation, focused growth is important to close the gap between my current position and my professional aspirations. To address these gaps, I brainstormed practical and achievable action steps. I dedicated myself to obtaining industry-recognized certifications, signing up for online courses, and pursuing guidance from seasoned experts and having a mentor. Additionally, I intend to offer my help for stretch assignments at my job and work together on interdepartmental initiatives to acquire practical experience. These steps are not only realistic but also aligned with my long-term goals. Contemplating this process has made me recognize the importance of proactive career planning. It has connected my self-awareness, future goals, and strategic planning into a distinct direction ahead, emphasizing the significance of taking responsibility for my career advancement
